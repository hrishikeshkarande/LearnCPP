}
// This code prints the ASCII values of the characters '?', '&', and '#'.
// The expected output is:
// 63
// 38
// 35
// The code uses the C++20 standard, which allows for cleaner syntax and better type inference.
// The characters are cast to integers to display their ASCII values, which is a common practice in C++ programming.
// The code is simple and straightforward, demonstrating basic character handling in C++.
// The use of `#include <iostream>` is standard for input/output operations in C++
// and is necessary for the `std::cout` functionality.
// The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program, and it returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
// The code is well-structured and adheres to C++ conventions
// for readability and maintainability.
// The use of `std::endl` ensures that the output is flushed to the console immediately
// and that each output is on a new line, which is a common practice in C++
// to enhance user experience.
// The casting of characters to integers is a common technique in C++
// to obtain their ASCII values, which can be useful in various applications,
// such as encoding, decoding, or simply displaying character information.
// The program is designed to be simple and educational, demonstrating basic concepts
// of character handling in C++ while adhering to modern C++ standards.
// The code is efficient and does not include unnecessary complexity,
// making it suitable for beginners to understand the basics of character representation in C++.
// The choice of characters '?' (63), '&' (38), and '#' (35)
// is arbitrary but serves to illustrate the concept of ASCII values effectively.
// The program can be compiled and run in any C++20 compliant environment,
// ensuring compatibility with modern C++ standards.
// The use of `int` for casting ensures that the ASCII values are displayed as integers,
// which is the expected output format for this program.
// The program does not require any external libraries or dependencies,
// making it easy to compile and run in any standard C++ environment.
// The simplicity of the program makes it an excellent starting point for those new to C++.
