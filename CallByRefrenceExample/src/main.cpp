Okay, let's break it down into simpler terms, especially since you're new to pointers.

Forget about code for a moment and think about houses and addresses.

-----

### Part 1: What is a Pointer? (Like an Address on a Piece of Paper)

Imagine you have a **house** (this is like an **object** in C++, like `Check a`).
This house is located somewhere in a city, and it has a unique **address**.

A **pointer** is like a **piece of paper** where you write down the address of a house.

  * The piece of paper doesn't *contain* the house itself.
  * It just tells you *where to find* the house.

In C++:

  * `Check a;`

      * This creates a `Check` "house" named `a`. It's located at a specific spot in your computer's memory (its "address").

  * `Check * b = &a;`

      * `Check * b`: This declares a variable `b` that is designed to hold the *address* of a `Check` object. We say `b` is a "pointer to a `Check` object."
      * `&a`: This `&` symbol means "give me the **address of** `a`."
      * So, `Check * b = &a;` means: "Get the address of house `a`, and write that address down on the piece of paper `b`."
      * Now, `b` (the piece of paper) "points to" `a` (the house).

-----

### Part 2: The `this` Pointer (Like Saying "This House I'm In")

Now, imagine you are *inside* a `Check` house (an object).
If you want to refer to the exact house you are currently in, you'd say "this house."

In C++:

  * Inside any method (function) of an object, there's a special, invisible pointer called `this`.
  * `this` always holds the **address of the object that called the method**.
  * So, if `a.someMethod()` is called, inside `someMethod`, `this` will be the address of `a`.

-----

### Part 3: The `isThisMe` Method (Asking "Is This Address the Same as My Address?")

Let's look at the `isThisMe` method:

```cpp
class Check {
public:
    bool isThisMe(Check * otherObjectPtr) {
        // This method receives a "piece of paper" (otherObjectPtr)
        // that has some house's address written on it.

        // It then compares:
        // 'this' (the address of the house I am currently in)
        // == (is it the same as?)
        // 'otherObjectPtr' (the address written on the piece of paper you gave me)

        return this == otherObjectPtr;
    }
};
```

So, `isThisMe` simply takes an address as input, and checks if that input address is the same as the address of the house it's currently living in.

-----

### Part 4: Putting It All Together in `main`

Let's trace what happens step-by-step in `main`:

1.  **`Check a;`**

      * A `Check` object (a "house") named `a` is created in your computer's memory. Let's say its unique address is **`ADDR_A`**.

2.  **`Check * b = &a;`**

      * A pointer variable (a "piece of paper") named `b` is created.
      * `&a` means "give me the address of `a`" (which is `ADDR_A`).
      * So, `b` now holds the value `ADDR_A`. `b` points to `a`.

3.  **`if ( b->isThisMe( &a ) ) { ... }`**

      * `b->isThisMe(&a)`: This is the crucial part.
          * `b->`: This means "Go to the house that `b` points to." Since `b` points to `a`, you are now "at house `a`."
          * `isThisMe(&a)`: You are calling the `isThisMe` method *on house `a`*.
              * When `isThisMe` is called on `a`, inside that method:

                  * The `this` pointer will automatically hold the address of `a`, which is **`ADDR_A`**. (Because `a` is the object calling the method).
                  * The `otherObjectPtr` parameter will hold the address that was passed as an argument. We passed `&a`, which is also **`ADDR_A`**.

              * So, the comparison becomes: `return ADDR_A == ADDR_A;`

              * This comparison is **`true`**.

4.  **The `if` condition is `true`:**

      * Because `b->isThisMe(&a)` returned `true`, the code inside the `if` block executes.
      * `std::cout << "&a is b \n";` is printed.

-----

**In simple terms:**

The code creates an object `a`. It then creates a pointer `b` and makes `b` store the exact memory address where `a` is located.
The `isThisMe` method simply checks if the address it was given as an argument is the *same* as the address of the object it's currently inside (which is `a` in this case).
Since we pass `&a` (the address of `a`) to `isThisMe` when `a` is calling it, the method correctly confirms that "Yes, the address you gave me is the address of *this* object."

It proves that `b` is indeed holding the address of `a`.
